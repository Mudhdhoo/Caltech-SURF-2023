Found problem:
Bhattacharyya coefficient is wrongly calculated for some reason. Exceeds 1 sometimes.

Problem seems to lie in calcluating the probabilities. P1_Z looks way too large.

Seems to be a problem in "rows, cols = np.nonzero(KER_above_threshold)". The values of rows and cols
dont match with MATLAB code. The indicies are not correctly ordered.

Difference between MATLAB's find() and python's np.nonzero: Python gives indices row by row while MATLAB
gives column by column. Fixed (kind of)

The lack of a python equivalen to ".'" in B_KER_Z_Jx seems to make fout much bigger than in MATLAB. Fixed

Gradients calculated incorrectly. The gradients are exploding as time goes on. Problems seems to lie in computing integral of Q(z).

Discovered difference in reshaping order of MATLAB and python. MATLAB reshapes column by column when flattening,
while python does row by row. Check if this affects anything. Probably not.

Diffusion seems to be wrong. Looks like the shift functions are broken in their paddings.

PROBLEM: The shift functions operate on the same array object (v) --> shifting left and right sequentially
leads to the SAME array being shifted. Need to make 2 copies of v. FIXED --> Diffusion should be bug-free

Next problem seems to be in grad_bhatt_u function.

Changing all Z0, indices and other non-deterministic stuff to be deterministic (hardcoded) for debugging.

Still doesn't work on simple image, but works much better on the heart image after bug fixing. It no longer
collpases into itself, even with np.maximum used in B_grad_u_integrand.
